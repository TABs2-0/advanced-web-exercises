# ICTU Smart Student Management Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](assets/docs/ictu-clone.png)
![Report Preview](assets/docs/ict-clone-report.png)

A fully client-side Student Management System for ICT University, built with plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. No backend, no build tools — just open `index.html` in a browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A — Open directly
Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser. Due to browser security policies around local file access, use a local server for the best experience.

### Option B — Local server (recommended)
```bash
# Python
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node.js
npx serve .

# VS Code
Install "Live Server" extension, right-click index.html → Open with Live Server
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8080`
